                         ----------------

In this document a howto is presented on the setup of LGI. The document
is divided into four parts. Part I will show you how to setup a resource
within an existing LGI project, part II will show you how to setup a new
LGI project with a project server. Part III will show you how to add an 
extra project server into an existing LGI project. The last part part IV
will detail on the maintenance of your LGI project servers.



Part I : Howto setup a resource 
-------------------------------

Setting up a resource within an LGI project is rather easy. Just follow the
following steps:

- Untar or checkout the source tree in '~/LGI'.

- Get in contact with the project administrator to get the X.509 certificate
  and a private key for your resource.

- Copy the key and certificate files into the '~/LGI/certificates' directory.

- Make sure that libcurl is installed. Visit http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/ if
  you do not have this yet.

- Go to the '~/LGI/src' directory and invoke make. If you have a different 
  compiler installed than GNU's g++, or you have libcurl installed in a 
  different location, adjust the first few lines of the file Makefile to
  your needs.

- If you want, you can also invoke make with the 'make install' command. If
  you do that the directory '~/LGI/bin' will be created and you can include 
  that in your PATH for convencience.

- Edit the '~/LGI/daemon/LGI.cfg' example configuration file. It has been
  setup to run the hello_world application by just simple forking scripts.
  Other example scripts on how to use the 'hello_world' example using Torque
  / PBS or LoadLeveler are included to in the corresponding '~/LGI/daemon/
  hello_world_XX_scripts' subdirectories. Please make sure you refer to
  the right LGI project server, use the correct project name and use the
  correct private key and certificate files from the '~/LGI/certificates'
  directory. Also be sure to use absolute paths in the configuration file
  so it is possible to invoke the daemon from any other directory. Finally
  set the run directory correctly if you do not want it to be the default.

- Start the daemon by invoking the daemon like:

  ~/LGI/daemon/bin/LGI_daemon -d -l ~/LGI/daemon/LGI.log ~/LGI/daemon/LGI.cfg

 You can now inspect the log file '~/LGI/daemon/LGI.log' and see if everything
 was setup correctly.

- You can gracefully stop the dameon by sending it a 'kill' signal:

  killall LGI_daemon

  While the daemon is running, you can edit the configuration file without any
  problems. You can also edit the scripts in the mean time, only newly spawned
  jobs will be affected by these changes. 

Keep in mind for a project administrator, you should also include the new resource
into the projects database. See part IV for an example.



Part II : Howto setup a project server 
--------------------------------------

Setting up your own project is not too hard either. You can decide to be
a fully independent project by setting up your own X.509 Certificate
Authority, or you can decide to be a sub project and thus be an X.509 sub-CA
of the LGI-CA. In this part, it is shown how to become an independant project
and be your own X.509 CA.

- Make sure libcurl, Perl, PHP, MySQL, Apache and OpenSSL are installed on 
  your system.

- Make sure MySQL is configured correctly and mysqld is running.

- Make sure PHP is configured correctly. It is highly recommended that you
  also correctly instal PHP PEAR so that you can install the APC PHP PECL 
  module too. It will enable caching of PHP bytecode from the ZEND engine
  and enhance the PHP performance significantly.

- Switch to the user apache and make sure you install the source tree
  into the home of user apache where it will be served:

  sudo su -l -s /bin/bash apache 

  tar -zxf LGI.tar.gz -C /var/www/html

- Use OpenSSL to create a CA private key and certificate with which you can
  create and sign your project server, resource and client certificates:

  Start by creating a private key for your CA:

    openssl genrsa -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key 4096    

  Then create an X.509 selfsigned certificate for it:

    openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -set_serial 0 -extensions v3_ca 
            -key /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key 
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt

  and create a CA serial number file:

    echo "0100" > /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.srl 

  Now create a private key for your server:
 
    openssl genrsa -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.key 4096

  Then create a sign request for it:

    openssl req -new -key /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.key 
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crs

  and in filling in the commonname of the CA certificate, be sure to use the 
  correct LGI format 'apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org; exampleprojectname'.

  Now create the CA signed server certificate from this request:

    openssl x509 -req -in /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crs
            -days 365 -CA /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt
            -CAkey /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key 
            -CAserial /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.srl 
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt

  You should now safely store the CA private key file somewere not on
  this server computer that is conected to the internet. Or, at least, if
  you do not do that, encrypt the file using a password protection:

    openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key.aes; rm 
            /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key

  Now copy the public certificates to a place that Apache will serve:

    cp /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt /var/www/html/LGI

    cp /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt /var/www/html/LGI

- Make sure Apache is setup correctly to use client and server certificates
  for https and check that the following options have been set correctly into
  the https (virtual host) configuration:

  SSLSessionCache shmcb:/var/cache/mod_ssl/scache(512000)
  SSLSessionCacheTimeout 5
	
  SSLCertificateFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.key
  SSLCertificateChainFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt
  SSLCACertificateFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt
  SSLVerifyClient require
  SSLVerifyDepth  5
  SSLOptions +ExportCertData

  <Files ~ "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php3?)$">
     SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
  </Files>

  Also make sure the AccessFileName has been set correctly in the Apache main
  configuration so that the LGI document tree can be protected by .htaccess
  files (if desired), make sure the important directories are carefully 
  protected and for performance reasons, make sure KeepAlive is turned on, 
  KeepAliveTimeOut is set low and MaxKeepAliveRequests set high in the
  main server configuration of Apache. Also make sure the Timeout is not to
  high and no DNS queries are perfomed for each request:

  DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
  AccessFileName .htaccess

  HostnameLookups off
  Timeout 15
  KeepAlive On
  KeepAliveTimeout 1
  MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

  Make sure you have an .htaccess file in the '/var/www/html/LGI/certificates', 
  '/var/www/html/LGI/inc', '/var/www/html/LGI/tools', '/var/www/html/LGI/daemon',
  '/var/www/html/LGI/scheduler', '/var/www/html/LGI/src', '/var/www/html/LGI/bin'
  and '/var/www/html/LGI/python' directories with the content:

  Make sure you have an .htaccess file in the '/var/www/html/LGI/repository'
  directory with the content:

  Deny from all

        SSLRequire ( %{SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY} == "SUCCESS" )

        Allow from all
        Options +ExecCGI
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
  </Files>

  Make sure you have an .htaccess file in the directories
  '/var/www/html/LGI/basic_interface', '/var/www/html/LGI/interfaces' and
  '/var/www/html/LGI/resources' with the following content:

  php_value upload_max_filesize 16M
  php_value post_max_size 16M

  Make sure you have an 'index.html' file in the subdirectories
  '/var/www/html/LGI/repository', '/var/www/html/LGI/inc', 
  '/var/www/html/LGI/interfaces', '/var/www/html/LGI/servers'
  '/var/www/html/LGI/resources', '/var/www/html/LGI/daemon', 
  '/var/www/html/LGI/tools', '/var/www/html/LGI/certificates',
  '/var/www/html/LGI/src', '/var/www/html/LGI/bin', 
  '/var/www/html/LGI/python' and '/var/www/html/LGI/scheduler'
  with the content:

  <html>
    ! No browsing allowed !
  </html>

  For high performance, make sure you scale the Apache MPM settings to your 
  needs taking the amount of RAM your server has into account:

     http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/prefork.html
     http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-tune-lamp-2.html

  It is also advised to set the net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout to 15s or less with
  the sysctl command. Make this setting permanent by adding it into the file
  /etc/sysctl.conf. This setting will make sure that keep-alive connections,
  when closed by Apache, do not linger to long until the client finaly closes
  the socket.
  
  Finally check your Apache configuration with the 'apachectl configtest' command.

  !!!!! WORD OF CAUTION !!!!!

  The above configuration of Apache seems superfluous but ensures a secure
  environment. Please be very carefull when diverting from the above
  suggested configuration. Web application security is a complicated matter
  and a lot of care has been taken to ensure a secure default configuration
  that will work out-of-the box mostly tuned for performance.

  !!!!! WORD OF CAUTION !!!!!


- Now create a MySQL user and database for your project with the database
  name equal to your project name "exampleprojectname":

  mysqladmin -u root password "yourmysqlrootpassword"

  mysqladmin -u root -p create "exampleprojectname"

  echo 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampleprojectname.* to 
       "examplemysqluser"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "examplemysqluserpasswd"'
       | mysql -u root -p mysql

  mysql -u examplemysqluser -p exampleprojectname < /var/www/html/LGI/LGI.db

  For high performance reasons you might want to set the the following options
  in /etc/my.cnf for MySQL if you have enough resources available:

    table_cache = 512
    max_connections = 128
    query_cache_size = 128M
    key_buffer_size = 128M
    sort_buffer_size = 128M
    query_cache_type = 1
    thread_cache_size = 64
    innodb_log_buffer_size = 16M
    innodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT
    innodb_fast_shutdown = 1
    innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0
    innodb_log_archive = 0
    innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2048M
    innodb_additional_mem_pool_size = 8M
    innodb_file_io_threads = 32
    innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 50
    innodb_thread_concurrency = 32

  See the LGI.pdf document for more details on scaling and performance.

- Insert your project server entry into the database by using the database
  management tool:

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB add resources allowed exampleprojectname
     localhost examplemysqluser examplemysqluserpasswd

    Enter resource name: apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org
    Enter resource url: https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI
    Enter certificate file: /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt
    Enter project server flag: 1
    Enter servers to update: any

  Just make sure you set the servers to be updated to 'any'. This will 
  make sure that this insert is recorded as update nr 1 and when adding
  slave servers later on, everything will be automatically synchronized.
 
- Make sure you edit the project web server configuration file 
  '/var/www/html/LGI/inc/Config.inc':

  $Config[ "SERVER_URL" ] = "https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI";    
  $Config[ "SERVER_NAME" ] = "apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org"; 
  $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE" ] = "../certificates/exampleserver.crt"; 
  $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_KEY" ] = "../certificates/exampleserver.key";
  $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE_URL" ] = 
           "https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI/exampleCA.crt";
  $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE" ] = "../certificates/exampleCA.crt";        
  $Config[ "MYSQL_URL" ] = "localhost";
  $Config[ "MYSQL_USER" ] = "examplemysqluser";
  $Config[ "MYSQL_PASSWD" ] = "examplemusqluserpasswd";
  $Config[ "MYSQL_DEFAULT_DATABASE" ] = "exampleprojectname"; 
  $Config[ "REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY" ] = "/var/www/html/LGI/repository";
  $Config[ "REPOSITORY_SERVER_NAME" ] = $Config[ "SERVER_NAME" ];
  $Config[ "REPOSITORY_URL" ]  = $Config[ "SERVER_URL" ]."/repository";   

- Edit the /var/www/html/LGI/scheduler/scheduler.php file if more than one 
  project is configured. Just uncomment the required array_push lines to
  add your projects to the list:

     array_push( $Projects, "secondprojectname" );  
     array_push( $Projects, "thirdprojectname" );  

  Each project has an independant database on the web server, by creating a
  second database, as described above, a second project has been setup.

  Edit the /var/www/html/LGI/scheduler/check_running script to use the correct
  LGI_ROOT directory to run the scheduler. Now you can start the scheduler on 
  the background like:

    /var/www/html/LGI/scheduler/check_running 

  You can also add a crontab entry to automatically check if the scheduler is
  running once per hour:

    1 * * * * /var/www/html/LGI/scheduler/check_running

  Your project servers has been setup now and can be used!

You could also choose to use a different user account to setup your LGI
project web-server. Just be sure that the user apache is part of the group 
the new user is part of too so that apache can serve the content. 



Part III : Howto setup a second slave project server 
----------------------------------------------------

After having successfully setup your first LGI master project server yourself,
adding slave servers is fairly straightforward. Follow the same procedure on 
the slave server as was described in part II for the master server, but now
there is no need to setup a CA. You only have to generate a server key and a
certificate request for the slave server, and obviously sign that request with
your CA certificate.

However, at the point where you insert the server entry into the fresh database
in part II, use that command now to insert the MASTER server data into the 
slave database:

  (on the slave server)

  wget https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/exampleCA.crt 
       -O /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt

  wget https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/exampleserver.crt 
       -O /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB add resources allowed exampleprojectname
     localhost exampleslavemysqluser exampleslavemysqluserpasswd
  
    Enter resource name: apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org
    Enter resource url: https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI
    Enter certificate file: /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt
    Enter project server flag: 1
    Enter servers to update: any

Again be sure to set the servers to be updated to 'any'. This will make sure
that the first update of this slave and of the master server are synchronized.
All other updates from the master server (including the addition of this
slave below) will be automatically picked up by this slave.

Now insert the slave server details into the master server database:

  (on the master server)

  wget https://exampleslaveserver.somewhere.org/exampleslaveserver.crt 
       -O /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleslaveserver.crt

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB add resources allowed exampleprojectname
     localhost examplemysqluser examplemysqluserpasswd

    Enter resource name: apache@exampleslaveserver.somewhere.org
    Enter resource url: https://exampleslaveserver.somewhere.org/LGI
    Enter certificate file: /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleslaveserver.crt
    Enter project server flag: 2
    Enter servers to update: any

Make sure you use the correct server flag value '2' and set the servers to be
updated to 'any'. This will make sure that all other slave servers will also
pick up the change and updates from the database. It will also make sure that
your slave server currently being setup will load it's certificate into it's
database through an update automatically. Just continue with configuring the
slave servers config file and scheduler as described in part II. When done, the 
two servers are linked together and the schedulers ensure that any updates 
pending in the 'updates' table of the master server database are transfered 
to the slave server. Users can now use both the slave and the master server 
independantly to submit jobs. The resource daemon will automatically request 
work from all servers of the project.



Part IV: Updating and maintaining project servers:
--------------------------------------------------

By default on each project server, the basic interface is active and
any user is allowed to have only two jobs in the database. If you want
certain users or groups of users to be able to submit more, you can add
that user or group with a new limit for a certain application. One
should do that with the ManageDB tool:

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB add users allowed exampleprojectname
     localhost examplemysqluser examplemysqluserpasswd

   Enter user name: theusername
   Enter application: hello_world
   Enter job limit: 10
   Enter servers to update: any

The ManageDB tool can be used to perform most project management tasks. If
you want, you can also configure it with default settings (see script itself)
to avoid long command with usernames and passwords:

  # some default settings...
  MYSQL_HOST="localhost"
  MYSQL_USER="examplemysqluser"
  MYSQL_PASSWD="examplemysqluserpasswd"
  MYSQL_DB="exampleprojectname"

To find out what can all be managed; just run the tool without any parameters:

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB

  ManageDB {list|add|del} {users|groups|resources} {allowed|denied} [DB [HST
    [USR [PWD]]]]

Also read the LGI documentation in the docs directory to understand what
limits can be set and what meaning they have. In general a limit value of 0
means there is no limit; a positive limit value means a maximum total number
of jobs limit and a negative limit is a maximum number of queued or running
jobs in the database. None the less please read the documentation to
understand which tables have precedence over what.

A new resource is also easily added now:

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB add resources allowed

  Enter resource name: user@resource
  Enter resource url: user@resource
  Enter certificate file: resource.crt
  Enter project server flag: 0
  Enter servers to update: any

Here a new group is added on the slave server only:

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB add groups allowed

  Enter group name: newgroup
  Enter application: any
  Enter job limit: -10
  Enter servers to update: apache@exampleslaveserver.somewhere.org

Or a user is denied on the master server only:

  /var/www/html/LGI/tools/ManageDB add users denied

  Enter user name: baduser
  Enter application: any
  Enter servers to update: apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org

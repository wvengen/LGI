                         ----------------

In this document a howto is presented on the setup of LGI. The document
is divided into four parts. Part I will show you how to setup a resource
within an existing LGI project, part II will show you how to setup a new
LGI project with a project server. Part III will show you how to add an 
extra project server into an existing LGI project. The last part part IV
will detail on the maintenance of your LGI project servers.



Part I : Howto setup a resource 
-------------------------------

Setting up a resource within an LGI project is rather easy. Just follow the
following steps:

- Untar or checkout the source tree in '~/LGI'.

- Get in contact with the project administrator to get the X.509 certificate
and a private key for your resource.

- Copy the key and certificate files into the '~/LGI/certificates' directory.

- Make sure that libcurl is installed. Visit http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/ if
you do not have this yet.

- Go to the '~/LGI/daemon/src' directory and invoke make. If you have a
different compiler installed than GNU's g++, or you have libcurl installed
in a different location, adjust the first few lines of the file Makefile to
your needs.

- If you want, you can also invoke make with the 'make install' command. If
you do that the directory '~/LGI/daemon/bin' will be created and you can
include that in your PATH for convencience.

- Edit the '~/LGI/daemon/LGI.cfg' example configuration file. It has been
setup to run the hello_world application by just simple forking scripts.
Other example scripts on how to use the 'hello_world' example using Torque
/ PBS or LoadLeveler are included to in the corresponding '~LGI/daemon/
hello_world_XX_scripts' subdirectories. Please make sure you refer to
the right LGI project server, use the correct project name and use the
correct private key and certificate files from the '~/LGI/certificates'
directory. Also be sure to use absolute paths in the configuration file
so it is possible to invoke the daemon from any other directory. Finally
set the run directory correctly if you do not want it to be the default.

- Start the daemon by invoking the daemon like:

  ~/LGI/daemon/src/LGI_daemon -l ~/LGI/daemon/LGI.log ~/LGI/daemon/LGI.cfg

You can now inspect the log file '~/LGI/daemon/LGI.log' and see if everything
was setup correctly.

- You can gracefully stop the dameon by sending it a 'kill' signal:

  killall LGI_daemon

While the daemon is running, you can edit the configuration file without any
problems. You can also edit the scripts in the mean time, only newly spawned
jobs will be affected by these changes. 



Part II : Howto setup a project server 
--------------------------------------

Setting up your own project is not too hard either. You can decide to be
a fully independent project by setting up your own X.509 certificate Center
of Authority, or you can decide to be a sub project and thus be an X.509
sub-CA of the LGI-CA. In this part, it is shown how to become an independant
project and be your own X.509 CA.

- Make sure libcurl, PHP, MySQL, Apache and OpenSSL are installed on your
system.

- Make sure MySQL is configured correctly and mysqld is running.

- Make sure PHP is configured correctly.

- Switch to the user apache and make sure you install the source tree
into the home of user apache where it will be served:

  sudo su -l -s /bin/bash apache 

  tar -zxf LGI.tar.gz -C /var/www/html

- Use OpenSSL to create a CA private key and certificate with which you can
create and sign your project server, resource and client certificates:

 Start by creating a private key for your CA:

    openssl genrsa -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key 4096    

 Then create an X.509 selfsigned certificate for it:

    openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -set_serial 0 -extensions v3_ca 
            -key /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key 
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt

 and create a CA serial number file:

    echo "0100" > /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.srl 

 Now create a private key for your server:
 
    openssl genrsa -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.key 4096

 Then create a sign request for it:

    openssl req -new -key /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.key 
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crs

 and in filling in the commonname of the CA certificate, be sure to use the 
 correct LGI format 'apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org; exampleprojectname'.

 Now create the CA signed server certificate from this request:

    openssl x509 -req -in /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crs
            -days 365 -CA /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt
            -CAkey /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key 
            -CAserial /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.srl 
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt

 You should now safely store the CA private key file somewere not on
 this server computer that is conected to the internet. Or, at least, if
 you do not do that, encrypt the file using a password protection:

    openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key
            -out /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key.aes; rm 
            /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.key

 Now copy the public certificates to a place that Apache will serve:

    cp /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt /var/www/html/LGI

    cp /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt /var/www/html/LGI

- Make sure Apache is setup correctly to use client and server certificates
for https and check that the following options have been set correctly into
the https virtual host configuration:

 SSLCertificateFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt
 SSLCertificateKeyFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.key
 SSLCertificateChainFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt
 SSLCACertificateFile /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt
 SSLVerifyClient require
 SSLVerifyDepth  5
 SSLOptions +ExportCertData

 <Files ~ "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php3?)$">
    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
 </Files>

 Also make sure the AccessFileName has been set correctly in the Apache main
 configuration and that the LGI document tree can be protected by .htaccess
 files:

 DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
 AccessFileName .htaccess

 <Directory "/var/www/html/LGI">
        AllowOverride All
 </Directory>

 Make sure you have an .htaccess file in the '/var/www/html/LGI/certificates'
 and '/var/www/html/LGI/inc' directories with the following content:

 Order Allow,Deny
 Deny from all

 Also sure you have an .htaccess file in the '/var/www/html/LGI/
 basic_interface/repository' directory with the following content:

 hp_flag engine off
 SSLRequireSSL

 Finally check your Apache configuration with the 'apachectl configtest' command.

- Now create a MySQL user and database for your project with the database
name equal to your project name "exampleprojectname":

  mysqladmin -u root password "yourmysqlrootpassword"

  mysqladmin -u root -p create "exampleprojectname"

  echo 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON exampleprojectname.* to 
       "examplemysqluser"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "examplemysqluserpasswd"'
       | mysql -u root -p mysql

  mysql -u examplemysqluser -p exampleprojectname < /var/www/html/LGI/LGI.db

- Insert your project server entry into the database:

  export CERTIFICATE=`cat /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt`

  echo "INSERT INTO active_resources SET resource_name=
       'apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org',project_server=1,
       url='https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI',
       client_certificate='$CERTIFICATE'" | mysql -u
       examplemysqluser -p exampleprojectname

- Make sure you edit the project web server configuration file 
'/var/www/html/LGI/inc/Config.inc':

 $Config[ "SERVER_URL" ] = "https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI";    
 $Config[ "SERVER_NAME" ] = "apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org"; 
 $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE" ] = "../certificates/exampleserver.crt"; 
 $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_KEY" ] = "../certificates/exampleserver.key";
 $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE_URL" ] = 
          "https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI/exampleCA.crt";
 $Config[ "SERVER_SSL_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE" ] = "../certificates/exampleCA.crt";        
 $Config[ "MYSQL_URL" ] = "localhost";
 $Config[ "MYSQL_USER" ] = "examplemysqluser";
 $Config[ "MYSQL_PASSWD" ] = "examplemusqluserpasswd";
 $Config[ "MYSQL_DEFAULT_DATABASE" ] = "exampleprojectname"; 

- The last thing to do is to edit a crontab entry for the apache user

  crontab -u apache -e

  Add the following lines:
 
  MAILTO=""
  HOME=/var/www
  */10 * * * *  /usr/bin/php -f /var/www/html/LGI/tools/cron_job.php
  


Part III : Howto setup a second slave project server 
----------------------------------------------------

After having successfully setup your first LGI master project server yourself,
adding slave servers is fairly straightforward. Follow the same procedure on 
the slave server as was described in part II for the master server, but now
there is no need to setup a CA. You only have to generate a server key and a
certificate request for the slave server, and obviously sign that request with
your CA certificate.

However, at the point where you insert the server entry into the fresh database
in part II, use that command now to insert the MASTER server data into the 
slave database:

  (on the slaveserver)

  wget https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/exampleCA.crt 
       -O /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleCA.crt

  wget https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/exampleserver.crt 
       -O /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt

  export CERTIFICATE=`cat /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleserver.crt`

  echo "INSERT INTO active_resources SET resource_name=
       'apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org',project_server=1,
       url='https://exampleserver.somewhere.org/LGI',
       client_certificate='$CERTIFICATE'" | mysql -u
       exampleslavemysqluser -p exampleprojectname

and insert the slave server details into the master server database:

  (on the masterserver)

  wget https://exampleslaveserver.somewhere.org/exampleslaveserver.crt 
       -O /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleslaveserver.crt

  export SLAVECERTIFICATE=`cat /var/www/html/LGI/certificates/exampleslaveserver.crt`

  export SLAVEINSERTQUERY="INSERT INTO active_resources SET resource_name=
       'apache@exampleslaveserver.somewhere.org',project_server=2,
       url='https://exampleslaveserver.somewhere.org/LGI',
       client_certificate='$SLAVECERTIFICATE'"

  export ESCAPEDSLAVEINSERTQUERY=`echo "$SLAVEINSERTQUERY" | sed "s/'/\\\\\'/g"`

  export UPDATEQUERY="INSERT INTO updates SET servers='any',
         update_query='$ESCAPEDSLAVEINSERTQUERY'"

  echo "$SLAVEINSERTQUERY" | mysql -u examplemysqluser -p exampleprojectname

  echo "$UPDATEQUERY" | mysql -u examplemysqluser -p exampleprojectname
  
At this point the two servers are linked together and the crontab entries
of both will ensure that any updates pending in the 'updates' table of
the master server database are transfered to the slave server. 

Users can now use both the slave and the master server independantly to submit
jobs. The resource daemon will automatically request work from all servers of 
the project.



Part IV: Updating and maintaining project servers:
--------------------------------------------------

By default on each project server, the basic interface is active and
any user is allowed to have only two jobs in the database. If you want
certain users or groups of users to be able to submit more, you can add
that user or group with a new limit for a certain application. One
should do that like:

  php -f tools/cron_job.php

  export QUERY="INSERT INTO users_allowed SET user_name='user', 
         application='hello_world', job_limit=10"

  echo "$QUERY" | mysql -u examplemysqluser -p exampleprojectname

  export ESCAPEDQUERY=`echo "$QUERY" | sed "s/'/\\\\\'/g"`

  export UPDATEQUERY="INSERT INTO updates SET 
         servers='apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org',
         update_query='$ESCAPEDQUERY'"

  echo "$UPDATEQUERY" | mysql -u examplemysqluser -p exampleprojectname

By also inserting an update query into the server database for this,
slave servers will automatically synchronize and also apply them if
needed. It also allows the easy addition of more slave servers as was
shown in part III. To make this easier, one can use the UpdateDB script
located in the tools subdirectory:

  tools/UpdateDB "INSERT INTO users_allowed SET user_name='user',
                 application='hello_world', job_limit=10" 
                 "apache@exampleserver.somewhere.org" -u examplemysqluser 
                 -p exampleprojectname

Beware, if you have password protected the account for user examplemysqluser
in MySQL, you need to type in your password twice with this UpdateDB script.

Please read in the docs subdirectory the full details on the structure
of the database, what the fields mean and what values you can assign to 
them with MySQL queries like demonstrated.

Sun June 6th -- Version 1.25
----------------------------

- Added this ChangeLog.txt file.
- Added new scheduler into project server code. A new table
  event_queue has been added in the database.
- The resource daemon has been modified to add a resource hash 
  into the job_specifics tag when a job is accepted. It is used
  by the daemon to check if a job has been taken over by another
  daemon on the same or different resource and should ignore the
  job but finish or abort gracefully on the resource if possible. 
- Added a deamon_pulse into the job_queue to detect daemons not
  running as they should (i.e. on a grid). Jobs can now be requeued.
- Added new priority field into the job_queue table. This allows
  a future version of the scheduler to supply QOS by assigning
  a different priority to jobs. Currently the priority is set equal
  to the time stamp of submit.


Sat June 26 -- version 1.26
---------------------------

- Added python client class into python dir.
- Moved daemon/src into root, adjusted makefile and so on.


Wed July 14 -- version 1.27
---------------------------

- Adapted daemon and tools to use persistent connections by
  reusing the cURL handle.
- Configured Apache for performance using keep-alive options.
- Updated documentation.
- Made sure that the python interface class also handles the
  persistent / keep-alive connections correctly.
- Made sure aborting jobs without a pulse are also nicely taken
  care of.
- Studied LGI under load and updated statistics in the 
  documentation.
- Made sure that MySQL connections are nicely closed on exits.
- Found a small race-condition in the resource request work API,
  it has been fixed and the resource locking has been optimized.
- Made sure cURL is setup and cleaned up nicely.
- Removed another small race-condition for resources and removed
  table locks from algorithm in interface job locks. 
- Using ctype_digit for checks and check limit values for 
  queries.
- Optimized locking for resources a bit more.
- Removed small race-condition in daemon_pulse field.
- Tweaked MySQL setup for better performance, ran tests again
  for updated stats in LGI.pdf.
- Added some extra indices to job_queue to avoid MySQL sorting 
  a bit more. The number of slow_queries dropped significantly.
- Removed duplicate indices.
- Use explicitly specified index for work requests and job
  lists so no 'ORDER BY' is needed to sort. Updated stats and
  documentation. Big improvements gained.
- Removed some php error messages for repositories.
- Added a check_running script for the LGI scheduler.


Wed August 11 -- version 1.28
-----------------------------

- Removed some old documentation and added new.
- Allow for project server scheduler unlimited run time.
- Limited the number of work request a resource can do.

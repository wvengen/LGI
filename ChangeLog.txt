Sun June 6th 2010 -- Version 1.25
---------------------------------

- Added this ChangeLog.txt file.
- Added new scheduler into project server code. A new table
  event_queue has been added in the database.
- The resource daemon has been modified to add a resource hash 
  into the job_specifics tag when a job is accepted. It is used
  by the daemon to check if a job has been taken over by another
  daemon on the same or different resource and should ignore the
  job but finish or abort gracefully on the resource if possible. 
- Added a deamon_pulse into the job_queue to detect daemons not
  running as they should (i.e. on a grid). Jobs can now be requeued.
- Added new priority field into the job_queue table. This allows
  a future version of the scheduler to supply QOS by assigning
  a different priority to jobs. Currently the priority is set equal
  to the time stamp of submit.


Sat June 26 2010 -- version 1.26
--------------------------------

- Added python client class into python dir.
- Moved daemon/src into root, adjusted makefile and so on.


Wed July 14 2010 -- version 1.27
--------------------------------

- Adapted daemon and tools to use persistent connections by
  reusing the cURL handle.
- Configured Apache for performance using keep-alive options.
- Updated documentation.
- Made sure that the python interface class also handles the
  persistent / keep-alive connections correctly.
- Made sure aborting jobs without a pulse are also nicely taken
  care of.
- Studied LGI under load and updated statistics in the 
  documentation.
- Made sure that MySQL connections are nicely closed on exits.
- Found a small race-condition in the resource request work API,
  it has been fixed and the resource locking has been optimized.
- Made sure cURL is setup and cleaned up nicely.
- Removed another small race-condition for resources and removed
  table locks from algorithm in interface job locks. 
- Using ctype_digit for checks and check limit values for 
  queries.
- Optimized locking for resources a bit more.
- Removed small race-condition in daemon_pulse field.
- Tweaked MySQL setup for better performance, ran tests again
  for updated stats in LGI.pdf.
- Added some extra indices to job_queue to avoid MySQL sorting 
  a bit more. The number of slow_queries dropped significantly.
- Removed duplicate indices.
- Use explicitly specified index for work requests and job
  lists so no 'ORDER BY' is needed to sort. Updated stats and
  documentation. Big improvements gained.
- Removed some php error messages for repositories.
- Added a check_running script for the LGI scheduler.


Thu August 19 2010 -- version 1.28
----------------------------------

- Removed some old documentation and added new.
- Allow for project server scheduler unlimited run time.
- Limited the number of work request a resource can do.
- Made index UNIQUE in running_locks.
- Made sure interfaces job list requests do sort the jobs on 
  state_time_stamp by using the available index, even when the
  table is small and the MySQL optimizer likes to ignore the
  indexs we made.
- Made sure that for the basic_interface the SID (to counter
  XSS attacks) is not reset each time index.php is hit.


Fri November 19 2010 -- version 1.29
------------------------------------

- Patched Ssl.inc to work with newer PHP 5.x (patch of Willem v.
  Engen).
- Added 'cd' trick to some tool scripts so they can be run from 
  any other directory.
- Added extra logging to stderr option for qstat tool.
- Made sure that for CLI tools arguments are numeric if needed.
- Added job count feature to request work for resources for future
  pilot job frameworks.
- Removed small update bug for master-slave servers.
- Added slave server capabilities report into daemon.


Fri March 11 2011 -- version 1.30
---------------------------------

- Patched repository content listing code. It had a security hole 
  found by Willem v. Engen.
- Removed some dead code in interface job state API.
- Added support for retreiving job count in interface API.
- Added support for specifying owners allowed or denied for 
  resources in resource request work API.
- Removed small bug generating php error messages in Utils.inc.
- Added support for reporting allowed and denied owners in daemon
  when requesting work.
- Added SIGHUP support in daemon for restarting logger.
- Made sure server updates use keep alives and caching in posting.
- Added support for relative paths in daemon config file, thanks
  to Willem v. Engen.
- Added the .spec files in specs to build RPMs on RHEL systems.
- Added support for more than 32k jobs in repository by adding 
  extra fan-out directory based on unique name. Limit is now 134M
  jobs on ext3 filesystem.
- Made sure .spec files create upgradable rpms and use correct source 
  URL.
- Removed small issues with relative paths in daemon config file.
- Made sure paths for daemon can have spaces.
- Updated default scripts a bit.
- Removed small scheduling bug from daemon.
- Tested .specs and code against RHEL 6; removed two small curl issues.
- Made sure that LGI python code can deal with limit=0 values.
- Updated documentation.
- Added configuration reload capabilities on SIGHUP into daemon.

Sun June 6th -- Version 1.25
----------------------------

- Added this ChangeLog.txt file.
- Added new scheduler into project server code. A new table
  event_queue has been added in the database.
- The resource daemon has been modified to add a resource hash 
  into the job_specifics tag when a job is accepeted. It is used
  by the daemon to check if a job has been taken over by another
  daemon on the same or different resource and should ignore the
  job but finish or abort gracefully on the resource if possible. 
- Added a deamon_pulse into the job_queue to detect daemons not
  running as they should (i.e. on a grid). Jobs can now be requeued.
- Added new priority field into the job_queue table. This allows
  a future version of the scheduler to supply QOS by assigning
  a different priority to jobs. Currently the priority is set equal
  to the time stamp of submit.
